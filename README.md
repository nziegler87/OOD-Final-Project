# Final Project for Object Oriented Design
## Overview
@tolliverdani and I worked together to build an application that created 2D animations based on declarative animation commands that were read from a text file. This was the final project for our OOD class and was a great learning experience to design a program from scratch and to apply object-oriented programming standards. We followed SOLID principles when designing the program. We designed and implemented interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes that were well-documented. Additionally, we implemented several design patterns including the factory and command patterns. The final piece of software allows the user to select a valid .txt file of declarative animation commands, pause/play the animation, remove shapes from the animation, and export a text-based version of the animation.

### Example Input and Output
- [Towers of Hanoi with 8 Discs](./Animation_Files/toh-8.txt) results in [Towers of Hanoi Visual Animation](https://youtu.be/uNaNL-mOHG8)
- [Big Bang Big Crunch](./Animation_Files/big-bang-big-crunch.txt) resultes in [Big Bang Big Crunch Visual Animation](https://youtu.be/uNaNL-mOHG8)
